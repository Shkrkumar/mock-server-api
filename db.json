Eden witnessed first-hand the hardships that the families in his community were faced with. Families often lived with only one bed per household and owned chairs made from solid wood that provided no comfort or warmth for their families. Eden was plagued by this injustice and believed that everyone had a right to be comfortable in their home. He made it his mission to provide quality furniture for his community regardless of their class or financial status. This wasn't an easy mission. Eden & Morgan had to work long hours while making use of limited materials. However, their dedication, compassion and determination drove this mission forwards. Morgan gave birth to two sons during the war and as they grew, they became part of this mission and the family business started to evolve. Mordenfort's Inspiration & Mission The company name was inspired by the Smith brothers in loving memory of their mother and father and is a combination of both of their names. Unfortunately, both Eden & Morgan died before the company was fully launched in 1970, however their vision, dedication and unshakeable work ethic lives on in Mordenfort's mission today. Mordenfort furniture provides everything that you need. Its regal yet modern feel is inspired by 1930's Britain and the furniture that Eden witnessed in the richer, more affluent homes of this time.
